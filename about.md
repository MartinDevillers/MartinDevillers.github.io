## Who am I?

My name is Martin Devillers and I am a Dutch stunt coder. Since the age of twelve, I have been busy tying the world together using a keyboard and a soldering iron. As with most computer junkies; my passion became my hobby; my hobby became my education and finally; my education became my job. As of 2007, I spent most of my time in the field designing solutions, crafting code and architecting ideas at various companies. Currently, I hold the position of [lead software engineer](http://www.linkedin.com/in/mdevillers) at a great Dutch IT Innovator called [Info Support](http://www.infosupport.com/). 

## How do you know all this stuff?

I was taught marvelous computer wizardry at the [Radboud University of Nijmegen](http://www.ru.nl/english/), the same university that brought us [Erik Meijer](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Meijer_%28computer_scientist%29). Apparently, I was good at paying attention in class, as I graduated with honors in 2011. Additionally, my [thesis](http://master.devillers.nl/) was [awarded most appealing thesis of the year](http://www.aiasoftware.com/index.php/en/press-releases/students-receive-aia-software-awards-2012-for-their-theses-on-yubikey-and-b/).

Besides theory, I had the privilege of working together with some absolutely fabulously minded tech-heads. 

Finally, I like to learn things by simply doing them myself. Autodidacticism has helped me acquire a great number of skills. Since people often like to talk about their learning process, here is mine:

 1.	Oh god I am doomed. DOOMED!
 2.	Let’s try something.
 3.	*Hilarity*
 4.	Pay penance on [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/users/546967/martin-devillers).
 5.	Improvement.
 6.	Great success.

## When did you get into IT?

I wrote my first program when I was twelve years old in a language called [GFA-BASIC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GFA_BASIC). Later, I moved to BASIC, Pascal, VB-Script, ActionScript, JavaScript and finally C#. As of 2004, my focus has been primarily on Microsoft technology, more specifically .NET and the ASP web-stack. Recently, my horizons have been broadened to building web applications using a variety of technologies. 

## Tell us something about your job experience.

There have been [a lot of projects](http://www.linkedin.com/in/mdevillers) which I contributed to. A few were solo jobs, but most were a team effort. The solo jobs covered a couple thousand lines of code. The large IT programs came close to a million. Some were finished in a week. Some took multiple years. Each project had its own challenges. Interestingly, often not related to IT at all.

When I work in teams I prefer adaptability over hierarchy and productivity over billable hours. 

Adaptability means I am whatever the team requires me to be. As an agile worker bee I design, develop, test, deploy and enjoy. No role is better than another. Leaders do no sit on thrones and architects do not push their ideas. 

Productivity means that I prefer to be benchmarked on output, rather than hours spent sitting behind a desk. Fortunately, my managers share these beliefs. Being benchmarked on output also means I can work anywhere, including from home. I am a firm believer in working from home when practical. Behind my workstation, I get a chance to change the world. In my car, I get to destroy the world with dangerous CO2 emissions. I prefer change for the better. To this extent, I have built myself a fancy home office. 

Although developing software is the greater part of my job experience, another important part is developing products and ideas. Through research, I’ve shown how existing products can be combined to create [new powerful products](http://www.aiasoftware.com/index.php/en/products/product/itp-for-sharepoint/). Through practice, I’ve demonstrated that these ideas also actually work. Besides tying products together, I’ve also managed the development of [a product](http://kanzi.azurewebsites.net) and acted as co-entrepreneur for another.
