The [Aia Software Thesis Awards](http://www.aiasoftware.com/index.php/en/news/aia-awards/) ceremony was held on 10 February 2012. It was a very fun day. I got to meet [Erik Meijer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_Meijer_%28computer_scientist%29), [Anarchist Software Architect at Microsoft](https://microsoft.fandom.com/wiki/Erik_Meijer_(computer_scientist)). My friends and family got to see a glimpse of my geeky side. And there were a lot of old colleagues and class mates which I caught up with. 

Thank you all for a wonderful day. At the bottom of this post are some picturesque highlights.

## What’s this all about?

In 2011 I finished seven math-filled years at the [University of Computer Wizards in Nijmegen](https://www.ru.nl/icis/). As with most university degrees, I completed mine by writing a master’s thesis. The thesis, called “[Business Process Modeling as a means to bridge The Business-IT Divide](http://master.devillers.nl)”, was the result of seven months of research into the practical applications of model-building in organizations. During my graduation ceremony, I was surprised to hear that my thesis won the prize of Most Appealing Master Thesis 2012
