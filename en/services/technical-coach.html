		<blockquote>Stimulate task-oriented independence, increase involvement and drive self-improvement</blockquote>
		<p>Software development is a team effort: professionals of various backgrounds work closely together to achieve a satisfactory result. Nevertheless, it can happen that Agile-teams have difficulty meeting their objectives. Scrum is focused on short-term planning and delivery, but when teams fail to deliver, every Sprint ends up in a setback. If this pattern continues to repeat itself, this can lead to a demotivated team.</p>
		<p>The reasons are many:</p>
		<ul class="disc">
			<li>Do developers and designers understand each other?</li>
			<li>Are development patterns applied in the right way?</li>
			<li>Are the Sprint objectives delineated?</li>
			<li>Is there a healthy balance between code and unit tests?</li>
			<li>Does the planning come from the team and does the team give commitment to the planning?</li>
			<li>Do developers possess the right knowledge to work effectively?</li>
			<li>Is Agile sufficiently embedded within the project and within the organization?</li>
			<li>Are the right tools used to support the development process?</li>
			<li>Is the code quality good enough or is it unnecessarily refactored?</li>
		</ul>

		<p>As a technical coach, I map out answers to the above questions and ensure that teams perform optimally. I supervise technical specialists in the execution of their work. From my experience as a <a href="/en/services/software-development/">senior lead developer</a> I recognize the strengths and pitfalls of a development team and I know where and when I need to steer.</p>
		<p>The role of technical coach is especially effective in teams with a lot of young talent: people with a lot of energy and potential, but who are not yet experienced enough to manage all facets of an IT project in a customer situation. Combining a team of young professionals with the seniority of a technical coach leads to a best-of-breed model. Playful yet professional, fast but stable. The customer gets a lot of value for a competitive price. The juniors make a real project and are eager to deliver. The supplier or organization develops his young talent. Win-win-win.</p>
