		<blockquote>Football is a game of mistakes. Whoever makes the least mistakes wins. - Johan Cruijff</blockquote>
		<p>We are in the middle of a digital revolution, the end of which is not yet in sight. Technological developments follow each other in rapid succession and our lives are increasingly interwoven with the digital world. The boundary between man and machine is fading. You can argue whether this is a positive change, but the course has been set and the world we live in today is a digitized world.</p>
		<h3>IT as a mission critical factor</h3>
		<p>The same applies to the role of technology within organizations. Even for organizations that had little affinity with IT in the past, the digital revolution has made it part of core business. As a result, using the power of IT has become a critical success factor. Unfortunately, it can also be an elusive success factor. You can talk to employees and product stocks are tangible. Information systems, however, are abstract and seem to be something magical for many. In practice, companies are confronted with both the possibilities and the impossibilities of IT.</p>
		<h3>My mission</h3>
		<p>As a techie, architect and entrepreneur, I make it my <strong>mission</strong> to bring organizations further with IT. My belief is that you can always do more with IT and that technology should <strong>never</strong> be the limiting factor. I turn mediocre systems into excellent systems and I turn excellent systems into awesome systems. I accomplish this using my in-depth technical knowledge of IT, a strong theoretical framework and a healthy dose of Dutch common sense.</p>
