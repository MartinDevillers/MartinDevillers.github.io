        I am a Senior Software Engineer on the <MdxLink href="https://www.t-mobile.com">T-Mobile</MdxLink> Manhattan
        Core Team. Our mission is to empower smartphone manufactures with the capacity to directly provision cellphone
        service on the devices they produce. Essentially, any store-bought device should have full service from day one.
        Simply unbox, turn on and enjoy service. In order to fulfill our mission, we are reconsolidating
        T-Mobile&rsquo;s internal micro-services landscape into a single unified set of fifty high-quality
        self-describing fully distributed API&rsquo;s and integrating this cryptographic device entitlement layer
        directly into the systems of <MdxLink href="https://www.apple.com">Apple</MdxLink>,{" "}
        <MdxLink href="https://www.samsung.com">Samsung</MdxLink> and more.

        My day to day consists of experimenting with techical POC&rsquo;s, turning said POC&rsquo;s into working
        solutions, guiding developers across teams and providing eye-in-the-sky support for anything related to{" "}
        <MdxLink href="https://redis.io">Redis</MdxLink>.
      </MdxText>
      <MdxText>
        I am the Technical Champion of the Control Object Storage Engine, a proprietary implementation of the
        distributed live-object model, essentially using <MdxLink href="https://redis.io">Redis</MdxLink> as a shared
        heap for JVM&rsquo;s running in different datacenters across the US.

        <MdxListItemTrophy>
          Reduced OP/s and memory footprint on <MdxLink href="https://redis.io">Redis</MdxLink> by 95% by singlehandedly
          implementing a custom Java serialization mechanism using{" "}
          <MdxLink href="https://cbor.io">Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)</MdxLink>,{" "}
          <MdxLink href="https://github.com/google/snappy">Google Snappy</MdxLink> for compression and{" "}
          <MdxLink href="https://redis.io">Redis</MdxLink> Bucket-based Storage.
        </MdxListItemTrophy>
        <MdxListItemTrophy>
          Improved performance (max-RPS) of <MdxLink href="https://graphql.org">GraphQL</MdxLink> API&rsquo;s by a
          factor of 4 by multiplexing internal query resolvers. Inflight IO-sensitive operations are batched and
          subsequently dispatched using a custom mechanism I implemented, similar to the{" "}

            Node.js Event Loop model

          , but then for JVM-based applications.

        <MdxListItemTrophy>
          Singlehandedly built TDOG, a tool engineers use to manage the micro-service ecosystem, including homogeneity
          of dependencies, release train consistency, and analyzing runtime telemetry for failure.

        I enjoy working on this project as I believe that internet access should be as frictionless as possible.{" "}
