**UPDATE**: NextJS [`v10.0.8`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/releases/tag/v10.0.8) fixes [this issue](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/22253)! If you're running into the above error: upgrade to the 10.0.8 (or beyond).

For those of you running the latest greatest of NextJS -- you may run into the following error while upgrading: `Error: Cannot find module 'sharp'`

```console title="npm run dev"
info sharp Downloading https://github.com/lovell/sharp-libvips/releases/download/v8.10.5/libvips-8.10.5-win32-x64.tar.br 
ERR! sharp getaddrinfo ENOTFOUND github.com 
info sharp Attempting to build from source via node-gyp but this may fail due to the above error
info sharp Please see https://sharp.pixelplumbing.com/install for required dependencies
```

So what is going on?

The required `sharp` dependency introduced with NextJS `10.0.5` has broken builds that depend on the underlying libvips, which isn't there in various Linux distros. Vercel is working on making the dependency optional. Relevant PR [here](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/21762) and [here](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/pull/20738). Related issue [here](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/issues/20456). This may be easier than trying to get libvips installed or compiled on your machine (I simply couldn't get it to work on my Amazon EC2 ARM-based machine). You can downgrade to NextJS `10.0.3` in the meantime. I think they'll fix it soon.
