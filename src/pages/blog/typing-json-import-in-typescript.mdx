Say you have a project built with [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). 
In this project, there is some static JSON data stored in `../data/applications.json`:

```json title=applications.json
[
    {
        "id": "elector-v3",
        "name": "Tesla Auto Pilot Elector API",
        "apiName": "tap-api-v3-elector",
        "apiPath": "/tap/v3/elector"
    },
    {
        "id": "clairvoyance-v2",
        "name": "Tesla Auto Pilot Clairvoyance API",
        "apiName": "tap-api-v2-clairvoyance",
        "apiPath": "/tap/v2/clairvoyance"
    },
    ... and many more...
]
```

With NextJS and TypeScript, you can import this data directly in a TS file:

```typescript title=awesome.ts
import applicationsData from "../data/applications.json"
```

You will notice when handling this data, TypeScript recognizes the shape of this data. 

But what if you want to take it a step further and use this shape as a discrete type? For instance, to use in functions or in React componenets?

# Type Alias to the rescue!

Assuming that each object in your array has the same four properties, then `typeof applicationsData[0]` will get you the appropriate type. You can then use a [Type Alias](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/advanced-types.html#type-aliases) to create a proper name for this type:

```typescript title=awesome.ts
type ApplicationData = typeof applicationsData[0]
```

Remember: using the inferred type will work for basic use cases like this, where you control the data and its structure is stable. You're basically using the first element as a "sample" for all the data within your array. For cases where the structure is more volatile it's better to define your own type definition by hand.
